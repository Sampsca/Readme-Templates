# Readme-Templates

This is my updated Readme template for Spellhold Studios mods.  Pull Requests with updates, corrections, additions, etc. will be considered for inclusion if and only if they are fully HTML5 and CSS3 compliant, and pass vigorous markup validation.  See <https://w3c.github.io/developers/tools/> for some excellent validators.  No attempt has been or will be made to support outdated/archaic web browsers.

The original version of the SHS Readme template was designed and coded by the khayman, found at "The Readme Project! " on SHS:  <http://www.shsforums.net/topic/31354-the-readme-project/>.
